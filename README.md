## Things to Consider

1. Everything is only developed and tested on MATLAB R2024b.
2. **BB** is an abbreviation for **Black Box Model** provided by the prof.
3. If the BB does not work, go to the on the simulink icon, click on the little arrow, inside, right click on the model and select `Explore` and in the freshly opened `Model Explorer` window, click browse and find the `.slxp` file associated with the BB. Apply the changes and save the file. This should fix the issue.
4. For each section, the only thing you need to do is to run the **Simulink** file usually named as `Model.slx`. It will automatically do the design, simulation, plotting and data saving(if it's supposed to).
